# List
A generic and extendable linked list object in C.

It uses the common "free(void *)" and "void *malloc(size_t)" to allocate and free dynamic memory.

NamedItem is an extension example.
It allows to attach names to items (max 64 characters).

## Style
In function names, I do not use short names like info, enum, init but full words for clearity: information,enumerator and initialize.
When I use the word "data" in the List context, I refer to the "void *" pointer in an Item as it can be of any size or type.
The functions do as little as possible to keep it transparent and clear. 

## examples
list creation:
```c

List *myList = List_create();

Item *myItem = Item_create(sizeof(Item));
myItem->data = "Some data";

List_appendItem(myList, myItem);

List_destroy(myList);


```
destroyList frees the list and all its items. 
It does not touch the data.
When the items data needs to be freed, loop thru the items to delete its data, before calling destroyList

List_remove does not destroy the Item. It is only detached from the list. use the standard free(myItem); to destroy it
An Item can only be added to one list. However, It can be detached from one and attached to the other.

to walk thru a list, use Iteration:
```c

Iteration i;

List_beginIteration(myList,&i);
Item *item;
while((item = iterate(i))){
   //do something with item->data
}


```
