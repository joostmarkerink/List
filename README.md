# List
A generic and extendable linked list object in C.

It uses the "C Standard General Utilities Library" to allocate and free dynamic memory.

NamedItem is an extension example.
It allows to attach names to items (max 64 characters).


When I use the word "data" in the List context, I refer to the "void *" pointer in an Item as it can be of any size or type.
