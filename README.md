# List
A generic and extendable linked list object in C.

This List contains a chain of Items, from Item list->first to Item list->last and keeps track of the length. The Iteration object is used to iterate thru this chain.

It uses the common [free(void *)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/free) and [void *malloc(size_t)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/malloc) to allocate and free dynamic memory.

NamedItem is an extension example.
It allows to attach names to items (max 64 characters).

## Style
In function names, I do not use short names like info, enum, init but full words for clearity: information,enumerator and initialize.

Object Oriented functions always start with the Object type name and finish with their function, like: List_create this way it's easier to remember how functions are named, and align nicely in the code layout.

When I use the word "data" in the List context, I refer to the "void *" pointer in an Item as it can be of any size or type.
The functions do as little as possible to keep it transparent and clear. 

## examples
list creation:
```c

List *myList = List_create();

Item *myItem = Item_create(sizeof(Item));
myItem->data = "Some data";

List_appendItem(myList, myItem);

List_destroy(myList);


```
List_destroy frees the list and all its items. 
It does not touch the data.
When the items data needs to be freed, loop thru the items to delete its data, before calling List_destroy

List_remove does not destroy the Item. It is only detached from the list. use the standard free(myItem); to destroy it
An Item can only be added to one list. However, It can be detached from one and attached to the other.

to walk thru a list, use Iteration:
```c

Iteration i;

List_beginIteration(myList,&i);
Item *item;
while((item = iterate(i))){
   //do something with item->data
}


```
